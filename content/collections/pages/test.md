Navigation and UX test for the new combined docs site.

The purpose of this test is to examine the navigability of the site using the top and left-side navigations. No effort was made to account for content in these pages.

Minimal effort was paid to the UX of the navigation elements. Bare bones expand / collapse functionality was added. This will be redesigned  during the design phase of this project.
