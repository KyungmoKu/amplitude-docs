Some of the most valuable analyses are the result of collaborations among teammates. **Spaces** help product teams subscribe to and organize analyses shared in Amplitude.

Every saved piece of content must live in a space. By default, content is saved into your personal workspace. You can also choose to move them into a shared space.

Content can only be saved to one location, but you can create [shortcuts](/analytics/collaborate-with-spaces) to that content in other spaces.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**.

### Restrictions

This feature is **limited** for users on **Starter** and **Plus plans**. 

* Organizations on **Starter** plans are limited to **one space**
* Organizations on **Plus** plans are limited to **three spaces**

## Your personal space

By default, any content you create will be saved to your own personal space, which you can access by clicking on your name in the *Favorite Spaces* tab of the *Spaces* drop-down. Here you'll find all your charts, notebooks, dashboards, folders, and archives, unless you opt to save them into a different space.

Your personal workspace and the folders within it are **not visible** to other people in your organization. Team members can still search for any content you've designated as **discoverable,** via Amplitude’s search feature (assuming they have project permissions to view it), and you can still share links to content that are located inside your personal workspace.

Click on a piece of content to open and edit it. To move, rename, archive, or pin a piece of content, check the box next to the content's name and click the appropriate button in the toolbar at the top of the list.

### Create a new folder

Folders are a convenient way to group related content together in a single, easily-viewable spot. To create a folder in a space, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your space and click *New Folder*.
2. In the modal that appears, give your folder a name and click *Create folder*.
3. Add content to your folder now, if you want. You can also do that later.

## Create a space

To create a space, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to *Create New > Space*.
2. Enter a name for your space, as well as a description, in the appropriate fields of the modal that appears.
3. In the *Members* field, select everyone who you want to join your new space. When you've finished, click *Create space*.

Users with admin, manager, and member-level permissions can create a space.

We recommend using naming conventions for your space that are recognizable throughout the organization, so that others can easily understand what the team space is all about.

A space can reuse a previously-used name for a new project, provided the previous project was deleted. 

There’s a lot more to effectively using spaces, so when you’re ready to explore further, check out [this article in the Amplitude documentation](/analytics/collaborate-with-spaces).
