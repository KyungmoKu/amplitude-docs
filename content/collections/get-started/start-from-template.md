In Amplitude Analytics, **templates** help teams efficiently recreate common analyses and share best practices with just a few clicks.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**.

Once you've built some analyses of your own, you can easily [create your own templates](/docs/analytics/templates). But before that day, you can use Amplitude's suite of starter templates in the **Template Gallery** to start generating insights into your users and their behavior.

Then just click on the template you're interested in to open it. Any templates you create in the future will also be found here.

If a process can be represented as a [funnel](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039976531), you should be tracking the steps in a Funnel Analysis chart. For example, tracking an onboarding funnel will help you quickly understand if first-time users are successfully navigating your signup process. A retention funnel will help you understand which parts of your product your users find confusing or frustrating, so you can spot and fix them quickly. If you need help deciding what events to track and in what chart, contact your dedicated Success Manager or reach out to us [here](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

You can find the Template Gallery by clicking *Start from a template* on the Amplitude Home page.
