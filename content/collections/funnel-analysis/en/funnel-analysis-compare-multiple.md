In a Funnel Analysis chart, you can compare up to three events within a single conversion step. After [step 4 of building your funnel](/docs/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/funnel-analysis-build), select *Compare Event* from the *Options* fly-out menu, and then select the events to compare.

Comparing multiple events within one step is available for conversion and conversion over time metrics. Three events may be compared per step, for up to two steps at a time. Event comparisons are available for all three order options (any order, this order, exact order); however, they are not available in dashboard filters, and will be removed if a user switches between charts or funnel metrics.
