Funnel charts allow you to compare a group-by property to another baseline property. Once your Funnel chart has a Segment property group-by, click the *Compare* dropdown to choose a value for comparison.

With that value selected, the conversion percentage difference will be seen on the microscope when hovering over a value in the visual, and the breakdown table. For a particular step in the breakdown table, youâ€™ll see both the absolute percent difference and the conversion percent difference.  
  
There are some limitations to Segment property group-by comparisons:

* They are only available for conversion and conversion over time.
* They are only applicable to compare to property value or compare to past.
* You are limited to a maximum of two segment group-bys.
