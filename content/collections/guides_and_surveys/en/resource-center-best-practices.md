- The Autopilot feature (if enabled) activates when no manual recommendation sets are available.
- The Autopilot feature uses a search algorithm that is based on semantic search to optimize relevance of the recommendation.
- Only one recommendation appears at a time.
- The priority level assigned to the source decides which article appears first. 
- If both articles have the same priority level, then the article that was most recently synced is given higher priority.
- There is functionality that lets you scrape content from a public website. However, websites with a lot of rich content or complex formatting may not reproduce exactly as expected. 
- If you want to remove an article from being visible to your users, set that article to Draft or otherwise unpublish it.
