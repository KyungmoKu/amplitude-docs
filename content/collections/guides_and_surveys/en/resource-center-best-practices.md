- The Autopilot feature (if enabled) activates when no manual recommendation sets are available.
- The Autopilot feature uses the same search engine as the main search functionality.
- Only one recommendation appears at a time.
- The priority level assigned to the source decides which article appears first. 
- If both articles have the same priority level, then the article that was most recently synced is given higher priority.
- There is functionality that lets you scrape content from a public website. However, the implementation is complex and documentation for this feature is forthcoming.
- Do not delete any article from your content repository. There isnâ€™t a way to recover that information and any future sync will ignore that specific article. It is better to unpublish an article and leave it in Draft mode.
