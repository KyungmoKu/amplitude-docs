Recommendation sets are customizable links and resources that you can embed throughout your website that help your users with information as they need it. You can think of them like personalized landing pages for your Resource Center. For example, you could create unique recommendation sets for:
Advanced articles targeted towards your power users.
Getting started articles for new users. 
Custom marketing campaigns to highlight new features on specific pages.

You can create as many Resource Center recommendation sets as you want. You can create multiple recommendation sets for specific pages or you could create a single recommendation set for your entire site. It is up to you how detailed you want to be.

This lets Amplitude determine which articles may be most relevant for users. Go to [Resource Center Autopilot](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-autopilot) for more information.
