  - 'Understand the basic concepts of the Resource Center'
---
Resource center is a widget that integrates directly into the [Guides and Surveys SDK](/docs/guides-and-surveys/sdk#content-security-policy-csp). It provides a way for you to surface insightful and useful information to your users from anywhere on your site. The Resource Center widget appears as a help icon that cusers can click to access help. The center itself provides:
- Search functionality
- Recommended content
- Persistent quick links
- Persistent call to action button

Content for your Resource Center can be external or publicly available documentation repositories, articles, videos, or third-party chat modules..

Other than the Guides and Surveys SDK, no other installation is needed to implement Resource Center.

Before your users can access the Resource Center to find relevant information, you must first set it up. Setting up the Resource Center includes the following activities:
- [Specifying the content][def] from which the Resource Center pulls information.
- [Creating the Resource Center links](/docs/guides-and-services/resource-center-recommendation-sets).
- [Setting up targetting and priority](/docs/guides-and-services/resource-center-targeting-recommendations) levels for users and pages.
- [Specifying the Resource Center settings](/docs/guides-and-services/resource-center-settings).
- [Reviewing Best Practices](/docs/guides-and-services/resource-center-best-practices) for the Resource Center.
