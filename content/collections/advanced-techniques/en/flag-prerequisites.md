As you run new experiments or roll out new feature flags, you may have features that are only relevant to users if another feature has been enabled for them. You may want to evaluate those dependencies first and then use those results in the evaluation of your flag or experiment.

Amplitude Experiment allows you to create dependencies for your flags and experiments on prerequisite flags or experiments.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Enterprise plans** who have **purchased Amplitude Experiment**. See the [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

## Configuring flag prerequisites 

Configure flag prerequisites in the _Dependencies card_, which you can find below the _Overview card_ for experiments and below the _Settings card_ for flags. 

For a given flag or experiment, this card provides a summary of all flag dependencies including its prerequisite flags, experiments, mutual exclusion, and holdout groups as well as a list of the flags and experiments that are dependent on it.

1. To configure new prerequisites, click the edit icon.
2. In the Dependencies edit drawer, click _Add Dependency_ to add a new prerequisite flag or experiment.
3. Select the flag or experiment you wish to create the dependency on.

    Flags and experiments are eligible to be used as a prerequisite if:
    - They're in the same project.
    - They have compatible evaluation modes. Local evaluation mode flags and experiments can only have local evaluation mode prerequisites. Remote evaluation mode flags and experiments can have both remote and local prerequisites.

    You can't add a prerequisite that would cause a circular dependency loop.

1. Then, select the variants that you want to be dependent on. _Off_ is a special value that represents when users weren't included in the prerequisite flag or experiment.
2. To finish adding the dependency, click _Save_.

## Workflow considerations

Before you activate a flag or start an experiment, ensure that prerequisite flags are active and variant assignment works as intended. You can't start the experiment until prerequisite flags and activate experiments.

For flags and experiments with dependents, Amplitude prevents the following actions:

- Deleting a variant or changing the variant key of a variant that another flag or experiment is dependent on.
- Archiving that flag or experiment.

## Example with evaluation details

This example provides you more information about how evaluation works when there are prerequisite flags.

Example scenario: I want to ensure that my new feature flag (Flag-B) rolls out to users who have seen another feature (Flag-A). In Flag-B, I have added a dependency for the _on_ variant of Flag-A and activated both flags.

When Amplitude evaluates users for Flag-B:

1. First, check if the user is in Flag-Bâ€™s testers.

   - If the user is a member of the testers, serve the configured variant to the user.
 
2. Evaluate the user for dependencies, in this case: Flag-A. 

   - If the user doesn't receive the _on_ variant for Flag-A, Amplitude excludes them from Flag-B.

3. Evaluate the user for Flag-B.

Targeting for Flag-B determines what variant (if any) the user receives, and the flag dependency on Flag-A has no effect at this point.
