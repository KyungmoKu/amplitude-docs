[Osano](https://www.osano.com/) is an easy-to-use data privacy platform that helps you keep your website compliant with laws such as GDPR and CCPA. Osano monitors all the vendors you share data with so you don't have to.

Osano connects to Amplitude with a one-click integration. Osano then discovers and automatically classifies the personal data stored in Amplitude. After Osano finishes discovery and classification, you can include Amplitude in searches related to subject rights requests.
