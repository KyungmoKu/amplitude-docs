You can update an event type's category directly from the *Events* tab. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the checkbox next to the event name.
2. From the *Categorize* drop-down, select the category to which this event should belong.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
This only applies to **active** events that are **included in your tracking plan**. It also **doesn't** apply to custom events.
{{/partial:admonition}}

You can also change the event's category from the *Category* column in the *Events* table or from inside its right-hand fly-out panel. From the *Events* table, change the status from the *Category* column's drop-down menu. Click the event name to open its *Details* panel, then navigate to *Category* and select the new category from the drop-down menu.
