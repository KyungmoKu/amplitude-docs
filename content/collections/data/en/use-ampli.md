**Ampli** dynamically generates a light-weight wrapper for the **Amplitude SDK** based on your analytics tracking plan in **Amplitude Data** making event tracking easier and less error-prone.

The **Ampli Wrapper** provides types and methods that prevent human error by strictly enforcing event names and property values. The wrapper code enables autocompletion for all events and properties in your tracking plan, as well as static type checks at development and compile time.
