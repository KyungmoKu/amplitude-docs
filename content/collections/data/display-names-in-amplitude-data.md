By default, a display name in Amplitude Data is whatever it was called in your tracking plan. However, these can be difficult to read, understand, and incorporate directly into your analyses. For this reason, you can give your events and user properties new display names that offer an easy-to-read description of their purpose and content.

This only applies to **active** events and user properties that are **included in your tracking plan**, and **doesn't** apply to custom events. It will also only change the display name of the event or property within the Amplitude UI and will not change the raw data.

## Change the display name for an event

You can update an event type's display name directly from the *Events* screen. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click *Events* in Amplitude Data’s left-hand rail.
2. Click the event name.
3. Type the new display name for the event.

## Change the display name for a user property

You can update a user property's display from the *User Properties* tab on the *Properties* screen. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click *Properties* in Amplitude Data’s left-hand rail and open the *User Properties* tab.
2. Click the property name to open the details panel.
3. Click the property name in the panel and enter a display name.
