With Amplitude's Snowflake integration, you can ingest Snowflake data directly into your Amplitude project. The integration supports four strategies to import your Snowflake data, depending on the data types you select.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading="Amplitude regional IP addresses"}}
Depending on your company's network policy, you may need add these IP addresses to your allowlist in order for Amplitude's servers to access your Snowflake instance:

| Region | IP Addresses                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| US     | `52.33.3.219`, `35.162.216.242`, `52.27.10.221` |
| EU     | `3.124.22.25`, `18.157.59.125`, `18.192.47.195` |

{{/partial:admonition}}

## Limits

- Maximum running time for a single Snowflake SQL query is 12 hours.

{{partial:admonition type="warning" title="User and Group properties sync"}}
Amplitude's Data Warehouse Import sometimes processes events in parallel, so time-ordered syncing of user and group properties on events isn't guaranteed in the same way as submitting events directly to the Identify and Group Identify APIs. 
{{/partial:admonition}}

## Add and configure the Snowflake source

Complete the following steps to configure the Snowflake source:

1. [Set up and verify the connection](#set-up-and-verify-the-connection)
2. [Select data](#select-data)
3. [Select the import strategy](#select-the-import-strategy)
4. [Map your data](#map-your-data)
5. [Schedule your sync](#schedule-your-sync)

### Set up and verify the connection

To add Snowflake as a data source in your Amplitude project, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude Data, navigate to **Catalog â†’ Sources**.

2. In the Warehouse Sources section, click **Snowflake**.

3. Enter the required credentials for the Snowflake instance you want to connect:

    - **Account**: Snowflake account name. Case sensitive. This is the first part of your Snowflake URL, before `snowflakecomputing.com`. Don't include ".snowflakecomputing.com" in your account name.
    - **Database**: Name of the database where Amplitude can find the data.
    - **Warehouse**: Used by Amplitude to execute SQL.
    - **Username**: Used by Amplitude for authentication.
    - **Password**: Used by Amplitude for authentication.

   Amplitude offers password-based and key pair authentication for Snowflake.

    - If you want to use password authentication, select **Password** and enter your password in the **Password** field.
    - If you want to use key pair authentication, select **Key pair** and then click **Generate Key**. Then provide the organization and account names in the format `ORGNAME-ACCOUNTNAME`.

4. Copy the autogenerated SQL query and run it in Snowflake to give Amplitude the proper permissions.

5. After running the query, click **Next** to test the connection.

6. After the test is successful, click **Next** again to move on to the data selection stage.

### Select the data type

The data type you select informs the strategies and settings available to you for configuration.

| Data Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Event            | Includes user actions associated with either a user ID or a device ID and may also include event properties.                                                             |
| User Properties  | Includes dictionaries of user attributes you can use to segment users. Each property is associated with a user ID.                                                       |
| Group Properties | Includes dictionaries of group attributes that apply to a a group of users. Each property is associated with a group name.                                               |
| Profiles         | Includes dictionaries of properties that relate to a user profile. Profiles display the most current data synced from your warehouse, and are associated with a user ID. |

### Select the import strategy

Select from the following strategies, depending on your data type selection. 

| Strategy  | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Sync | Ingests the entire dataset on a defined schedule. This option is useful for datasets that change over time, but can't show which rows are changed. |
| Timestamp | Ingests the most recent rows in the data on a schedule, as determined by the Timestamp column.                                                     |
| Change data capture (CDC) | Ingests the most recent rows of data on a schedule, as determined by Snowflake's Change Data Capture feature. CDC supports customization of the Feed Type (for Event data) and Data Mutability Settings.|

See the following table to understand which data types are compatible with which import strategies.

| Data type | Supported import strategies |
| -------| ----- |
| Event | CDC, Timestamp |
| User properties | Full Sync, Timestamp |
| Group Properties | Full Sync, Timestamp |
| Profiles | CDC |

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading="Change Data Capture options"}}
For the Event data type, the CDC strategy supports configuration of the CDC Feed Type. 

Select *Ingestion Only* to ingest from your warehouse and include Amplitude's enrichment services like ID Resolution, property and attribution syncing, and location resolution.

Select *Continuous Sync* to mirror your Snowflake data with support for `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations. This option deactivates Amplitude's enrichment services to ensure you remain in sync with your source-of-truth.

*Continuous Sync* also supports Data Mutability settings. Select which options to enable, `update` or `delete`. `insert` operations are always on.
{{/partial:admonition}}

### Map your data

Depending on the Import Strategy you choose, you'll map your data with a SQL statement to transform the data (Timestamp, Full Sync) or use the Data Selection Tool to map column names directly to Amplitude properties.

### Schedule your sync

Provide a name for the source, and select the frequency with which Amplitude imports your data.

## Choose the best integration for your use case

When choosing an integration strategy, consider the following:

- **Full Sync**: Choose this option if you need to periodically ingest the entire dataset and can't track which rows have changed. This method is best for smaller datasets in which you can't track incrementally. This method isn't suitable for large datasets due to the overhead required to ingest all data each time.

- **Timestamp Import**: Choose this option if you can incrementally import data using a monotonically increasing timestamp column that indicates when records when Snowflake loads the records. This is efficient and works well when you append new data with timestamps.

- **Change Data Capture (CDC) Ingestion Only**: Choose this option to import data based on changes detected by Snowflake's CDC feature while still using Amplitude's enrichment services. This method only supports insert operations.

- **Change Data Capture (CDC) Continuous Sync**: Choose this option to directly mirror the data in Snowflake with insert, update, and delete operations based on changes detected by Snowflake's CDC feature. This method disables Amplitude's enrichment services to remain in sync with your source of truth and is ideal when you need to keep Amplitude data fully synchronized with your Snowflake data, including mutations.

{{partial:partials/data/snowflake-strat-comp}}

## Prerequisites and considerations for CDC

When using CDC Continuous Sync, be aware of the following limitations:

- **Enable Change Tracking**: Enable change tracking for the source table or view. See [Enabling Change Tracking on Views and Underlying Tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-manage.html#label-enabling-change-tracking-views) in Snowflake's documentation.

- **Data Retention Settings**: `DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS` must be greater than or equal to `1`, but Amplitude recommends at least `7` days. Otherwise, the change-based import fails. For more details, see [Time Travel](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel) in Snowflake's documentation. Setting `DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS` to `0` disables the change tracking and causes the connection to become unrecoverable. If this happens, recreate the source.

- **Disable Change Tracking**: If you disable change tracking in Snowflake or disconnect the Amplitude source for a period longer than the value of `DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS`, Amplitude loses the ability to track historical changes. In this case, recreate the connection. To avoid duplicate events, ensure all events have an `insert_id` set, and recreate the connection within seven days.

- **Unique and Immutable `insert_id`**: Ensure the data to be imported has a unique and immutable `insert_id` for each row to prevent data duplication if there are any unexpected issues. More about Amplitude deduplication and `insert_id` is available in [Event Deduplication](/docs/apis/analytics/http-v2/#event-deduplication).

- **Complex SQL Statements**: If a data source is represented as a complex SQL `SELECT` statement (for instance, with a `JOIN` clause), create a `VIEW` in your Snowflake account that wraps the data source to use it with a change-based import strategy. See [Streams on Views](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro#streams-on-views) for considerations when using CDC with views in Snowflake.

- **Views with JOINs**: While Snowflake CDC is efficient, using views that contain JOINs can have performance implications. Consider syncing joined data as User Profiles instead.

- **Avoid Table Deletion and Recreation**: Don't delete and recreate tables with the same name, as Snowflake CDC doesn't capture changes in this scenario. Use [incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models) with tools like [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) to prevent table replacement.

- **Handling Schema Changes**: CDC supports adding new columns with default `NULL` values to CDC-tracked tables or views. Amplitude recommends against other kinds of schema changes. Snowflake CDC only reflects changes from DML statements. DDL statements that logically modify data (such as adding new columns with default values, dropping existing columns, or renaming columns) affect future data sent to Amplitude, but Snowflake doesn't update historical data with changes caused by DDL statements. As a result, Amplitude doesn't reflect these updates for historical data.

- **Amplitude Enrichment Services Disabled**: When using CDC **Continuous Sync**, Amplitude disables enrichment services like ID resolution, property and attribution syncing, and resolving location info to remain in sync with your source of truth.

## Migrate from custom SQL to CDC

To change the modeling method of your Snowflake source:

1. (Optional, recommended). Ensure the data you plan to import has a unique and immutable `insert_id` in each row to prevent data duplication. For more information, see [Data deduplication](/docs/apis/analytics/http-v2/#event-deduplication).
2. If the source uses complex SQL, including `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses:
      1. Create a [`VIEW`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-introduction) in your Snowflake account that wraps the data source.
      2. Enable [Change Tracking](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-manage.html#label-enabling-change-tracking-views) on the new view.
      3. Update the current Snowflake SQL import configuration to use the newly created view. Record the time of the update.
      4. Ensure `Data synced as of` is greater than the time recorded in the previous step to prevent potential data discrepancy and failure to identify the data drift after the latest completed import job.
3. Enable [Change Tracking](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-manage.html#label-enabling-change-tracking-views) on the source table or view, if you haven't done so. Record the time of the update.
4. Ensure the existing connection has `Data synced as of` (presented on the source detail page) on or after `October 1, 2023, 12:00 AM UTC`. If it doesn't, either re-enable the connection and wait for `Data synced as of` to advance or consider creating a new import connection. Otherwise, Amplitude imports all data from the current source, which may cause data duplication.
5. Ensure `Data synced as of` is greater than the time recorded in the step 3 to prevent potential data discrepancy and failure to identify the data drift after the latest completed import job.
6. Disable the source from the *Manage Import Settings* dialog. If the source has a status of In-Progress, wait for the job to complete and the status changes to Disabled.
7. Navigate to *Edit Import Config* and click *Convert To Table Select Import*.
8. Re-enable the source.
9. Monitor incoming data for one day to ensure the import works as expected.

### Roll back to a custom SQL connection

To revert to a custom SQL connection from an already migrated source, open the source configuration and click *Revert to SQL Query Import*.

{{partial:admonition type="info" title="Snowflake data sources"}}
When you roll back from the Change Data Capture to Custom SQL connection in the, use the same data source (table or view) in Snowflake to avoid inconsistencies.
{{/partial:admonition}}

## Data fields

Include the mandatory fields for the data type when you create the SQL query. These tables outline the mandatory and optional fields for each data type. Find a list of other supported fields for events in the [HTTP V2 API documentation](/docs/apis/analytics/http-v2/#keys-for-the-event-argument) and  for user properties in the [Identify API documentation](/docs/apis/analytics/identify/#identification-parameter-keys). Add any columns not in those lists to either `event_properties` or `user_properties`, otherwise it's ignored. 

### Events

### Group properties

| Column name (must be lowercase) | Mandatory                           | Column data type      | Example                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `groups`                        | Yes                                 | VARIANT (JSON Object) | {"company":"amplitude", "team":["marketing", "sales"]} |
| `group_properties`              | Yes                                 | VARIANT (JSON Object) | {"location":"seattle", "active":"true"}                |

Each group property in `group_properties` would apply to every group in `groups`.

To use a group property:

- Set group properties. The following is an example of how you can do it in Snowflake Group Property Import:

  ```SQL
  SELECT OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('customerId', account_id)                      AS "groups",          -- must be JSON
        OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('companyName', name, 'customerType', type) AS "group_properties" -- must be JSON
  FROM "AMPLITUDE"."DWH"."ACCOUNTS"
  ```

- Send events with group properties associated. These can be dummy events, so long as the user ID and groups are there. Specify the following in your Snowflake Event Import:

  ```SQL
  "groups": {"customerId": <account_id>}
  ```

## SQL query examples

To make the data selection step a bit easier, here are few example SQL snippets to get you started.

### Event data example

```sql
SELECT
 Â Â Â EVENT_TYPE_COLUMN AS "event_type",
 Â Â Â EVENT_PROPERTIES_VARIANT_COLUMN AS "event_properties",
 Â Â Â TIME_EPOCH_MS_COLUMN AS "time",
 Â Â Â USER_ID_COLUMN AS "user_id",
 Â Â Â USER_PROPERTIES_VARIANT_COLUMN AS "user_properties"
FROM DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_OR_VIEW_NAME
```

### User property example

```sql
SELECT
 Â Â Â USER_ID_COLUMN AS "user_id",
 Â Â Â USER_PROPERTIES_VARIANT_COLUMN AS "user_properties"
FROM DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_OR_VIEW_NAME
```

### Group property example

```sql
SELECT
 Â Â Â GROUPS_OBJ AS "groups",
 Â Â Â GROUP_PROPS_OBJ AS "group_properties"
FROM DATABASE_NAME.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_OR_VIEW_NAME
```

### Common snippets

Creating a JSON Object:

`OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('city', CITY, 'state', STATE) as "user_properties"`

Converting timestamp column to milliseconds:

`DATE_PART('EPOCH_MILLISECOND', TIMESTAMP_COLUMN) as "time"`

Converting milliseconds to TIMESTAMP_NTZ format needed for time-based import. This example uses the `scale` argument set to `3` to convert to milliseconds. See the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_timestamp.html) for more details.

`TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(TIME_COLUMN_IN_MILLIS, 3) as "update_time_column"`

Converting a timestamp column with a timezone to TIMESTAMP_NTZ format needed for time-based import.

`TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', TIMESTAMP_TZ_COLUMN)) as "update_time_column"`
