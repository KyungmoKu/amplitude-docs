With the Qualtrics event ingestion integration, you can send survey data to Amplitude when a response is received, to enable data-driven charts and cohorts in Amplitude.

After you connect the integration you can:

- Send an event to Amplitude when someone completes a survey.
- Send any event or user properties collected as question responses or embedded data.
- Send survey response data to build charts and cohorts in Amplitude.

## Considerations

- This integration imports the email address as the `User_ID`. There is no option to define the mapping and select another `User_ID`.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You need your Qualtrics Survey ID and API key. 

### Amplitude setup

2. In the Other Sources section, click **Amazon S3**.
3. Paste your Survey ID and Qualtrics API Key, then click **Request Survey Info**.
4. Copy the autogenerated JSON payload on the right-hand side of the page.
