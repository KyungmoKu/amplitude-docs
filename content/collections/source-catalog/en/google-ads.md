Amplitude Data's Google Ads integration lets you import your Google Ad spend, click, and impression data in just a few steps.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To set up, you need the following:

- [Google Ads Customer ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en) of the ad account you want to connect to.
- If you don't have direct access to the account, `Google Ads Manager ID` that you authorized access on which can view this ad account.

### Considerations

- This source imports **metrics data** from Google Ads. It doesn't import other types of data, like experiments.
- Amplitude's Google Ads integration imports data from Google Ads **once a day**, so your Daily Ad Metrics populates all at once. Check the time of the next sync in the settings.
- The advertising data you import is associated with a new Amplitude event called `Daily Ad Metrics`. This event has several event properties, like `Ad Impressions`, `Ad Clicks`, and `Ad Group ID`. The following user properties are set with the “Daily Ad Metrics” event: `UTM Campaign`, `UTM Content`, `UTM Medium`, `UTM Source`, and `UTM Term`. For more information, see [Ad-Network Integrations in Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/blog/ad-network-integration)
- Google Ads import pulls data and clicks on a **per-ad** level. The advertising metrics and properties aren't tied to users and display along with the `Display Ad Metrics` event. Therefore, `Daily Ads Metric` events might be the only event showing up in your users' event stream.
- You can't import data from a Google Ads manager account (MCC). The MCC, if provided, is only used to access data from the one account with the provided customer ID. Amplitude doesn't import data from that MCC account or any other accounts it accesses.
- You can import data from exactly one Google Ads customer account (not MCC) per Amplitude project.

### Amplitude setup

In Amplitude, navigate to **Data Sources**, then find **Google Ad** in the **I want to import data into Amplitude** tab.

1. Log into Google and grant Amplitude permission in the consent form.
2. Enter the Google Ads Customer ID for the ad account you want to import data from.
3. If you don't have direct access to the account, enter the `Manager ID` that you authorized access on which can view this ad account. Otherwise, just leave the field as blank.
4. [Optional] Import past data for a given period.

For more information on how you can use the data from this integration in Amplitude, see [this blog post](https://amplitude.com/blog/ad-network-integration).

## Common issues

### Insufficient permissions

Amplitude's Google Ads Import integration requires that your Google Ads Manager account has administrator privileges. This level of permission allows Amplitude to add and remove users from specific user lists in Google Ads.
For more information, see [About access levels in your Google Ads Account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556) in Google's documentation.

### Import job ingests no data

- Unplanned data: check if you reject unplanned events in your [Schema settings](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055495852-Configure-the-Schema-settings-to-handle-unexpected-data). If you reject unplanned data,  Amplitude doesn't store the event or its properties.
- Matching users: check if your users have corresponding accounts in Amplitude and Google Ads. Google Ads import tries to match users between platforms based on the key-value pairs you selected. If your import job doesn't find any corresponding values, it fails.

### Daily ad metric discrepancies

Your metrics may occasionally update days after a click occurs. This can happen for many  reasons, including but not limited to:

- When a conversion occurs days after the initial click
- When the source detects and removes invalid traffic

Hence, if Google updates the data afterward - the import job needs to run again to get the updated numbers.
For more information, see [About data freshness](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2544985?hl=en) in Google's documentation.
