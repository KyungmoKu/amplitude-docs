Apphud can send subscription events into Amplitude to help enrich your Amplitude user profiles with subscriptions revenue. This is useful for seeing all events and revenue that occur for your app even if itâ€™s not active for a period of time. 

## About Apphud

[Apphud](https://apphud.com/) is a revenue data platform designed for mobile app teams to scale results and grow even faster by making data-driven decisions. Apphud boosts in-app subscriptions growth by helping you deliver web-to-app ads and centralizing app revenue data for analysis.
