Datazoom enables video publishers to better operate distributed architectures through centralizing, standardizing, and integrating data in real-time to create a more powerful data pipeline and improve observability, adaptability, and optimization solutions.

Use this integration to send raw, standardized Datazoom video events into Amplitude.

### Setup

### Amplitude setup

Copy the Amplitude API key for your project. There are no other setup steps in Amplitude.

### Datazoom setup

See the [Datazoom documentation](https://help.datazoom.io/hc/en-us/articles/360046468532-Amplitude) for more details and instructions.

1. In Datazoom, navigate to **Settings**.
2. Create an Amplitude Connector in your [Datazoom account](https://app.datazoom.io/signup).Â 
3. Enter your Amplitude API Key and name the Connector to save it.
4. Add the new Amplitude Connector to a [Data Pipe with an active Data Collector](https://help.datazoom.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015525691-How-to-configure-a-Data-Pipe).
5. Follow the prompts to configure your connector.
    - Sampling Rate - select the percentage of sessions that you would like to have delivered to your Connector destination.
    - Redirect Standard Fields - Select this if you would like Datazoom to redirect Amplitude's standard fields to custom user properties. For example, if checked the `City` data point maps to a user custom property named `dz_city` 
6. Click **Save Changes** to complete setup.
