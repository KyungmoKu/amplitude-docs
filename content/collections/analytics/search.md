Amplitude's Search feature is a handy and simple way to locate charts, dashboard, and cohorts created by other members of your organization. Amplitude will generate results in real time as you make changes to your search parameters.

Items set by their owners to be non-discoverable will not turn up in search results, unless you are a manager or admin.

## Search for charts, dashboards, cohorts, and notebooks

1. In the top navigation bar, click the Search icon.
2. In the *Search* field above the drop-down, enter the word or phrase you'd like to search for. Or scroll through the pre-populated list for the item you want. Items are listed in order of most recent edits.
3. To sort your results by either the date they were last edited, or by the total number of views, click *Advanced Search*. Select your preference from the drop-down menu at the top of the list of results.
4. To add a filter, click *Advanced Search* or the filter icon inside the Search box. In the *Filter By* section, set up any filters you'd like to include in this search. Your options include:

      * Limiting your search to **archived** items only
      * Limiting your search to **official content** only
      * Limiting your search to **templates** only
      * The**space** the item belongs to
      * **Type** of item (chart, cohort, dashboard, experiment, flag, or notebook)
      * The **editor**, or creator, of the item
      * The **project** the item belongs to
      * The **last edited date** in which the item was **last edited** (in the last week, last month, last year, or any time)

5. Click on any item in the list of results to open it.

## View hidden items (admin or manager only)

Admins and managers can find items that have been set by their owners to be non-discoverable through search. To do so, type `is:unlisted`  in the search box. You will then be able to see all unlisted items for the entire organization.
