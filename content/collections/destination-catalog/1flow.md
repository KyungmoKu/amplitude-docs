[1Flow](https://1flow.app/) enables product-led customer everboarding through embedded onboarding checklists, contextual guides, and empty states. Customers can get set up at their own speed, track progress, and collaborate across their team.

## Considerations

- This integration is only available for customers who have paid plans with both 1Flow and Amplitude.
- You must enable this integration for each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- To use this integration, you must have an Amplitude User ID that maps to a 1Flow user profile. 1Flow supports the User ID field, and you should make sure to use the same User IDs across 1Flow and Amplitude.

## Setup

This guide is complementary to 1Flowâ€™s instructions.

### 1Flow setup

1. Log into your 1Flow Dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Integrations page and open Amplitude settings.
3. Enable **Sync Amplitude user cohorts to 1Flow** option under Cohort Sync.
4. Copy the API key (and use this to add 1Flow destination in Amplitude).
5. When finished, save your work.

### Amplitude setup

1. In Amplitude Data, click **Catalog** and select the **Destinations** tab.
2. In the Cohort section, click **1Flow**.
3. Enter a name and 1Flow API key. 
4. Map the **Amplitude User ID field** to the **1Flow User ID field**.
5. Save when finished.

## Send a cohort

To sync your first cohort, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude, open the cohort you want to sync, then click **Sync**.
2. Select **1Flow**, then click **Next**.
3. Choose the account you want to sync to.
4. Set the sync cadence.
5. When finished, save your work.
