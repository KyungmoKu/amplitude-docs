  - 'By sending cohorts or segments of users from Amplitude to The Trade Desk, advertisers can refine their audience targeting. For instance, if Amplitude identifies a group of users who have exhibited certain behaviors or engagement patterns (for example, frequent app usage, specific in-app actions), you can send this cohort to The Trade Desk for more precise ad targeting. This approach helps advertisers reach users who are more likely to convert based on their past behavior.'

When Amplitude sends cohorts to The Trade Desk, advertisers can tailor their ad content to match the interests and preferences of specific user groups, increasing the likelihood of capturing their attention and driving conversions."
