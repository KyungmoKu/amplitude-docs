use_cases:
  - 'By sending cohorts from Amplitude to Pushwoosh, you can create personalized push notification campaigns based on specific user behaviors or characteristics. For example, you could target users who have recently completed a certain action in your app, such as making a purchase, with a personalized thank-you message or exclusive offer.'
  - 'Identify cohorts of users who are at risk of churning based on their behavior patterns in Amplitude. You can then use Pushwoosh to send targeted re-engagement campaigns to these users, offering them incentives or reminding them of the value your app provides.'
  - 'You can use cohorts to split your audience and perform A/B tests on different push notification messages to understand what resonates better with specific segments of your user base. This can help optimize the content and timing of your push notifications for maximum impact.'
