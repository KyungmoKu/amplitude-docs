The Taxonomy API lets you create, get, update, and delete categories, event types, event properties, and user properties. You can edit planned events and properties, and not events and properties that already have data in the project.

Amplitude customers who wish to use the Taxonomy API should reach out to their Customer Service Manager or the Amplitude Support team.
