{{partial:collapse name="When does my subscription renew?"}}
Your subscription will automatically renew every 12 months if you are on the annual plan, or the first of every month if you are on the monthly plan.
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="What happens if I go over my quota?"}}
Overage fees apply to any monthly tracked users (MTU) or events in excess of the Plus plan volume at the end of each month. Overage fees are charged at 1.2x the customer’s price per MTU or per event (as applicable).
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="What is an MTU guardrail?"}}
To maintain quality service and protect against unexpected surges, we’ve incorporated a guardrail of an average of up to 1,000 events per MTU.

For example, a customer who purchases 10,000 MTUs can ingest up to 10,000 MTU x 1,000 events = 10M events in aggregate per month. Most customers will never hit this limit. If you do go over this limit, each additional 1,000 events (or portion thereof) will be converted to one MTU and charged according to the overage fee schedule.

{{partial:collapse name="What is the cancellation policy?"}}
You can cancel your subscription at any time before your next renewal period. You will have access to your Plus plan until the end of your current subscription period. 

For more information on MTUs and billing, please see the [Help Center article on MTU billing](/docs/admin/billing-use/mtu-guide).

{{partial:collapse name="How can I turn off automatic renewal for my subscription?"}}

This option is available to the user who originally made the purchase, and all admins in your organization.
