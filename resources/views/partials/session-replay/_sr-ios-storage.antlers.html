## Session Replay storage

If a user opts out tracking in your app, use the `optOut` configuration option to disable replay collection for that user.

Session Replay temporarily stores replay data data on the file system before it is uploaded. At every initialization, the least recent replays are trimmed to bring the total disk usage down to a maximum size.
