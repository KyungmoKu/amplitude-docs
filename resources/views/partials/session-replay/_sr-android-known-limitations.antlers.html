## Known limitations

Keep the following limitations in mind as you implement Session Replay:

- Session Replay doesn't stitch together replays from a single user across multiple projects. For example:
  
    - You instrument multiple apps as separate Amplitude projects with Session Replay enabled in each.
    - A known user begins on one app, and then switch to another.
    - Amplitude captures both sessions.
    - The replay for each session is available for view in the corresponding host project.

- The User Sessions chart doesn't show session replays if your organization uses a custom session definition.
- Session Replay for Android doesn't support Jetpack Compose
- Session Replay can't capture the following Android views:

    - WebView
    - MapView
    - Canvas Views
