## Troubleshooting

For more information about individual statuses and errors, see the [Session Replay Ingestion Monitor](/docs/session-replay/ingestion-monitor).


### Multiple Amplitude instances

Session Replay supports attaching to a single instance of the Amplitude SDK. If you have more than one instance instrumented in your application, make sure to start Session Replay on the instance that most relates to your project.

### Replay length and session length don't match

In some scenarios, the length of a replay may exceed the time between the `[Amplitude] Start Session` and `[Amplitude] End Session` events. This happens when a user closes the `[Amplitude] End Session` occurs, but before the iOS SDK and Session Replay middleware can process it. When the user uses the app again, the SDK and middleware process the event and send it to Amplitude, along with the replay. You can verify this scenario occurs if you see a discrepancy between the `End Session Client Event Time` and the `Client Upload Time`.

### Session replays don't appear in Amplitude

Session replays may not appear in Amplitude due to:

- Lack of connectivity
- No events triggered through the iOS SDK in the current session
- Sampling

#### Lack of connectivity

Ensure your app has access to the internet then try again.

#### No events triggered through the iOS SDK in the current session

Session Replay requires that at least one event in the user's session has the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. If you instrument your events with an analytics provider other than Amplitude, the iOS SDK may send only the default Session Start and Session End events, which don't include this property.

For local testing, you can force a Session Start event to ensure that Session Replay functions.

1. In Amplitude, in the User Lookup Event Stream, you should see a Session Start event that includes the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. After processing, the Play Session button should appear for that session.

#### Sampling

As mentioned above, the default `sampleRate` for Session Replay is `0`. Update the rate to a higher number. For more information see, [Sampling rate](#sampling-rate).

#### Some sessions don't include the Session Replay ID property

Session replay doesn't require that all events in a session have the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property, only that one event in the session has it. Reasons why `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID`  may not be present in an event include:

- The user may have opted out or the session may not be part of the sample set given the current `sampleRate`. Increasing the `sampleRate` captures more sessions.
- Amplitude events may still send through your provider, but `additionalEventProperties` doesn't return the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. This can result from `optOut` and `sampleRate` configuration settings. Check that `optOut` and `sampleRate` are set to include the session.

### Session Replay processing errors

In general, replays should be available within minutes of ingestion. Delays or errors may be the result of one or more of the following:

- Mismatching API keys or Device IDs. This can happen if Session Replay and standard event instrumentation use different API keys or Device IDs.
- Session Replay references the wrong project.
- Short sessions. If a users bounces within a few seconds of initialization, the SDK may not have time to upload replay data.
- Replays older than the set [retention period](#retention-period) (defaults to 90 days).
