## Session Replay storage

If a user opts out tracking in your app, use the `optOut` configuration option to disable replay collection for that user.

(alpha) Session Replay stores data in persistent storage, specifically the file system. For testing purposes, it also stores data in local storage.

- Memory usage grows until you call `flush()` to transfer the session replay data to the server.
- Session data isn't retried on failure to transfer to the Amplitude servers.
