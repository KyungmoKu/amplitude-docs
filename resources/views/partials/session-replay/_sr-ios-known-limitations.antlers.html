## Known limitations

Keep the following limitations in mind as you implement Session Replay:

- (alpha) Session replay may not support all view components. Contact Amplitude (with a session replay link) for more information.

- Session Replay doesn't stitch together replays from a single user across multiple projects. For example:
  
    - You instrument multiple apps as separate Amplitude projects with Session Replay enabled in each.
    - A known user begins on one app, and then switch to another.
    - Amplitude captures both sessions.
    - The replay for each session is available for view in the corresponding host project.

- The User Sessions chart doesn't show session replays if your organization uses a custom session definition.

- Session Replay cannot capture the following iOS views:

    - Out-of-process iOS views, such as SFSafariViewController
    - AVPlayerLayer backed views
    - MKMapView
    - WKWebView
